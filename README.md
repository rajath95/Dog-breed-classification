# Preprocessing of data 

Organized the images into the respective folders using preprocessing function named folder_creation()

# Image classification of data

I used transfer learning method for this classification. For this I used retrain.py function released by Tensorflow for 
retraining a given model.

I used the default parameters for training the model-

Model used: Inception v3.0


Training_steps: 4,000


Learning_rate: 0.01


Testing_percentage: 10


Valiation_percentage: 10

Batch size for training: 100

# Inference data

I have created an inference file for testing the model
